Add the dependencies to your project:

```groovy
implementation 'com.snakydesign.watchdog:core:0.9.0'
debugImplementation 'com.snakydesign.watchdog:interceptor-okhttp:0.9.0'
releaseImplementation 'com.snakydesign.watchdog:interceptor-okhttp-no-op:0.9.0' //add no-op dependency for non-debug build variants
```

Setup
-----

#### OKHttp And Retrofit
**Add the interceptor to your OKHttp Client**
```kotlin
        val watchTower = WatchTower(listOf(WebSocketTowerObserver(8085)))
        val watchTowerInterceptor = WatchTowerInterceptor(watchTower)

        val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
                // ...
                .client( // add the interceptor to your OKHttp client for Retrofit
                        OkHttpClient.Builder()
                                .addInterceptor(watchTowerInterceptor)
                                .build()
                )
                .build()

        watchTower.start()
```

Note: you should call `watchTower.shutDown()` whenever your application is terminating to close the WatchTower service and its related thread. It's best to start and shut down the WatchTower inside an android service (using `onCreate` and `onDestroy` of an Android Service)

**Observing the events using your browser**
Connect the device that is running the app to the same network that you want to observe the data first. So if you are on a WiFi, both devices should be connected to the same WiFi so they can communicate with each other.
After running your application, you can navigate to `http://yourip:8085/` and view the network calls. If you don't know `yourip`, It will be printed out to the console with the message of `WatchTower started, listening on ... `.
