Setup
-----

#### OKHttp And Retrofit
**Add the interceptor to your OKHttp Client**
```kotlin
        val watchTower = WatchTower(WebSocketTowerObserver(8085))
        val watchTowerInterceptor = WatchTowerInterceptor(watchTower)

        val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
                        .client(
                            OkHttpClient.Builder()
                            .addInterceptor(WatchTowerInterceptor())
                            .build()
                        )
                        // ...
                .build()

        watchTower.start(WebWatchTowerObserver(port = 8085)) // in Application class
```

Note: you should call `watchTower.shutDown()` whenever your application is terminating to close the WatchTower service and its related thread.
If you're using it on Android, It's best to start and shut down the WatchTower inside an Android service (using `onCreate` and `onDestroy` of an Android Service)

**Observing the events using your browser**
Connect the device that is running the app to the same network that you want to observe the data first. So if you are on a WiFi, both devices should be connected to the same WiFi so they can communicate with each other.
After running your application, you can navigate to `http://yourip:8085/` and view the network calls. If you don't know `yourip`, It will be printed out to the console with the message of `WatchTower started, listening on ... `.
